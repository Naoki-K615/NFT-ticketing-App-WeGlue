## NFT Event Tickets  
## Redefining How You Attend, Collect, and Celebrate Events!

Say goodbye to paper tickets, scalpers, and fake entries. This project brings blockchain-powered NFT tickets to your favorite events, making every ticket secure, verifiable, and collectible.

**No more scalpers:** Smart contracts can limit resale and prevent black-market abuse.

**Immutable and secure:** Each ticket is stored on-chain, verifiable, and impossible to counterfeit.

**Digital collectibles:** Keep your ticket forever — show off your attendance as a digital badge.

**Rewards for attendees:** Event organizers can reward ticket holders anytime, even months or years later.

This repository demonstrates a full NFT ticketing system, from smart contracts to web frontend, giving developers a ready-to-use framework to build the next generation of event experiences.

## Problems with current ticketing:
1. Paper tickets can get damaged and are hard to keep as collectibles. 
2. Digital tickets on phones aren’t memorable or fun to keep.
3.  Online ticket sales are often abused by bots and scalpers.
4. Fake tickets are common.
5. Event organizers and celebrities struggle to reward attendees directly.

## Why NFT tickets?
NFT tickets solve many of these problems: 
1. They can prevent scalping by restricting transfers after the first sale. 
2. They can’t be faked because they exist on the blockchain. 
3. Everyone can verify them on-chain. 
4. They make tickets memorable collectibles.
5. Organizers can reward NFT holders anytime, even long after the event.
